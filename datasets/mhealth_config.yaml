# Classification prompts configuration
prompts:
  system_prompt: |
    Perform a simple template matching in which each activity has a template vector of mean values for its
    standard segments. Compare the candidate’s mean vector to each template, choosing the template with the
    minimal absolute difference across components.

  user_prompt: |
    You are given summary statistics for chest, ankle, and arm sensors across whole segments for labeled samples and one unlabeled candidate. 
    NEVER depend on the number of samples per class. Use the provided samples as reference patterns only. Make a decision based on the closest matching pattern.
