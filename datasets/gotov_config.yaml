# Preprocessing configuration
preprocessing:
  window_size: 24 # Window size in samples
  train_step: 12 # Step size for training (50% overlap)
  test_step: 24 # Step size for testing (no overlap)

  # Subject splits
  exclude_subjects: [2, 3, 4, 12, 19, 23] # Subjects to exclude from dataset
  test_subjects: [5, 15, 30] # Subjects for test set
  val_subjects: [13, 21, 29] # Subjects for validation set

# Feature extraction configuration
# Sensor columns: ankle_x, ankle_y, ankle_z, wrist_x, wrist_y, wrist_z, chest_x, chest_y, chest_z
features:
  statistics:
    - mean
    - std
    - min
    - max
    - median
    - p25
    - p75
    - peak_to_peak
    - dominant_freq

# Classification prompts configuration
prompts:
  system_prompt: "Use semantic similarity to compare the candidate statistics with the retrieved samples and output the activity label that maximizes similarity; respond with only the class label from {classes} and nothing else."
  user_prompt: |
    You are given summary statistics for sensor data across temporal segments for labeled samples and one unlabeled candidate.

    --- CANDIDATE ---
    Time Series:
    {candidate_series}

    --- LABELED SAMPLES ---
    {retrieved_data}
