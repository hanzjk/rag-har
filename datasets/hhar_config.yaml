# HHAR (Heterogeneity Dataset for Human Activity Recognition) Configuration
# Preprocessing is implemented in providers/hhar/provider.py

dataset_name: "hhar"
description: "Heterogeneity Dataset for Human Activity Recognition - Smartwatch Sensor Data"

# Data source configuration
data_source:
  data_dir: "Activity recognition exp" # Directory containing Watch_accelerometer.csv and Watch_gyroscope.csv

  # Activity labels (excluding null)
  activities:
    - bike
    - sit
    - stand
    - walk
    - stairsup
    - stairsdown

# Preprocessing configuration
preprocessing:
  window_size: 200 # Window size in samples (2 seconds at 100Hz)
  overlap: 0.5 # Overlap ratio (0.5 = 50% overlap)
  sampling_rate: 100 # Sampling rate in Hz
  test_ratio: 0.2 # Ratio of users for test set (if not using manual test_user)
  test_user: null # Manual test user selection (e.g., 'd') or null for automatic

# Feature extraction configuration
# Sensor columns: acc_x, acc_y, acc_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z
features:
  statistics:
    - mean
    - std
    - min
    - max
    - median
    - p25
    - p75

# Classification prompts configuration
prompts:
  system_prompt: "Analyze all the given LABELLED SAMPLES and the CANDIDATE statistics, and give the activity label that the CANDIDATE closely resembles from the LABELLED SAMPLES. Respond with only the activity id from the following options: [0,1,2,3,4,5]."
  user_prompt: |
    You are given summary statistics for sensor data across temporal segments for labeled samples and one unlabeled candidate.

    --- CANDIDATE ---
    Time Series:
    {candidate_series}

    --- LABELED SAMPLES ---
    {retrieved_data}
